# GoalTracker

**GoalTracker** is a production-ready ASP.NET Core Web API designed to help users create, track, and manage their daily goals.  
The project follows **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is made for studying it and structured around Clean Architecture with clear separation between layers:

- **Domain**  
  Core business logic, entities, and value objects

- **Application**  
  Use cases, service interfaces, DTOs, validators

- **Infrastructure**  
  EF Core persistence, repository implementations, Identity, JWT handling

- **API**  
  Controllers, request/response models, Swagger setup, middleware

- **Tests**  
  Unit and integration tests for reliability
